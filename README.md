# Knight_Escape
Knight Escape is a unique twist on a traditional chess game that challenges players to make strategic moves using the knight chess piece.

## Objective
The board starts with a single white knight in the bottom left corner, a blank square in the top right, and the remaining spaces occupied by black knights. The player's goal is to navigate the white knight to the empty square using the fewest possible valid knight moves.

**Rules:**
- The knight moves as it does in standard chess, meaning in an L-shape.
    - Either two squares horizontally and one vertically.
    - Or two squares vertically and one horizontally.

## Game Interface
Throughout the game, the board's layout is printed for the player, reflecting the current state of play. To visually differentiate the pieces, the game utilizes Unicode characters:
- White Knight: ♘ (`\u2658`)
- Black Knight: ♞ (`\u265E`)

Depending on the development environment, these Unicode characters might not render as expected. It's advisable to adjust character settings in the environment or temporarily replace them for better visibility during development.

## User Interaction
When prompted:
- Enter `'x'` or `'X'` to exit.
- Enter `'r'` or `'R'` to reset the board.
- Enter `'m'` or `'M'` to make a move.

The game is case-insensitive, handling both uppercase and lowercase inputs seamlessly.

## Scoring Mechanism
The player starts with a score of 500 points. The objective is to achieve the goal with the highest score remaining:
- A valid move deducts 5 points.
- An invalid move deducts 10 points.

If the score drops to zero or below, the game ends.
